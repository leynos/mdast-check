# Developers' guide

This guide records development practices specific to maintaining mdast-check.
Follow the project-wide guidance in `AGENTS.md` first.

## Spelling policy

Run `make spelling` to enforce en-GB-oxendict prose spelling. The gate
regenerates `typos.toml` from the live shared dictionary and the
`typos.local.toml` overlay on every run, so `typos.toml` is never drift checked
in continuous integration (CI). Put narrow repository-specific exceptions in
`typos.local.toml`; never edit generated entries by hand.

## Coverage ownership

The trunk owns both persistent coverage outputs. On a push to `main`,
`.github/workflows/coverage-main.yml` measures coverage, writes the ratchet
baseline, and uploads the report to CodeScene. Pull-request CI measures the
same selection only to compare it with that baseline: it archives no report,
never calls CodeScene, and never receives `CS_ACCESS_TOKEN`. The call is what
moves to the trunk, not the archive: the uploader pins the `cs-coverage`
archive by digest, but the client refuses to run whenever CodeScene's API
changes shape, and on the trunk such a change no longer fails every pull
request.

The publisher never binds the token in an `env` block, because the uploader is
a composite action that would pass a step's environment on to its nested steps.
A check step writes whether the secret is set, the upload runs only when it is
and only for `refs/heads/main`, and the token reaches the uploader solely as its
`access-token` input. Runs share one concurrency group per ref and are never
cancelled, so triggered runs (a push or a dispatch) upload in commit order. A
manual re-run of an older run is an operator action: it republishes that
commit's coverage and baseline until the next push supersedes it.

Two gaps are known and accepted. Merges made by the Dependabot automerge
workflow with `GITHUB_TOKEN` fire no push, so they reach the publisher only
through a dispatch or the next ordinary push. A dispatch that replaces a
pending push uploads the same or a newer commit, but the shared action writes
the baseline only on a push, so the baseline stays one push behind until the
next one.

`make workflow-contracts`, which pull-request CI runs, holds this shape in
`tests/workflow_contracts/`. It reads every workflow strictly (a repeated key
is an error) and follows local reusable-workflow calls transitively, so a
called workflow cannot reach CodeScene on a pull request's behalf.

## The build standard

Development, test, lint and typecheck builds use the parallel `rustc` frontend
(`-Zthreads=8`) and, on Linux, the `mold` linker (`-Clink-arg=-fuse-ld=mold`).
These are defaults in `.cargo/config.toml`, which Cargo discovers on its own,
so a bare `cargo build` gets them. `mold` ships for Linux only, so the linker
flag lives in a Linux-only table and macOS and Windows keep their platform
linker. Cargo selects one `rustflags` source rather than merging them, so every
source repeats the same flags apart from the linker.

An assigned `RUSTFLAGS` replaces the configuration's flags, so the Makefile
recipes that set it compose the standard's flags onto any inherited value (CI's
`setup-rust` exports one). Two builds are deliberately excluded: coverage
assigns `RUSTFLAGS` without the fast flags, because a measurement should not
depend on them, and release builds keep the platform linker.

### Cranelift

Exception: Cranelift is not the development-profile backend, because the
repository has no test suite to measure it with. The estate adopts the backend
only where the full suite passes under it, and a build alone proves nothing
about miscompilation or unwinding (recorded 2026-09-29, on the pinned
`nightly-2026-03-05`). Revisit when the repository has tests: measure the whole
suite under the backend and adopt it if every test passes.
